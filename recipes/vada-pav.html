        <h2>About</h2>
        <p><em>Often called the "Indian burger," Vada Pav is Mumbai’s most iconic street food — simple, spicy, and deeply satisfying. It features a golden, deep-fried potato fritter (vada) tucked into a soft bun (pav), typically slathered with spicy green chutney, tangy tamarind sauce, and a sprinkle of dry garlic chutney for that fiery punch.
What makes Vada Pav truly special is its universal appeal — from office-goers to college students, street vendors to stockbrokers, it’s a snack that unites Mumbai. Whether you're rich or poor, Vada Pav is a humble favorite that transcends class, offering bold flavors and comforting familiarity in every single bite.</em></p>
