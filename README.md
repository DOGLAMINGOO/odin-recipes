# Odin Recipes

This is my first project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).
It focuses on practicing the basics of HTML. This project showcases a collection of recipes, designed to help me get comfortable with HTML structure and elements.

## What I Learned
- How to create and organize webpages using semantic HTML tags 
- Adding links, lists, images, and text formatting 
- Structuring content in a clear and user-friendly way 
- Basic web project setup and deployment on GitHub Pages 

## Project Overview
The site displays recipes with their ingredients and preparation steps. 
It demonstrates simple navigation between pages using anchor links and basic HTML formatting.

## How to View
You can view the project by opening the `index.html` file in your browser, 
or online via GitHub Pages at:
